            <p>Hello and welcome! My name is <strong>Sydney Colledge!</strong> I am so happy that you found yourself to my page! Before I jump right in to <a href="designs.html">my design work,</a> I want to tell you a little about myself. </p>
            <p>I am 23 years old and I am currently a <em>Graphic Design </em> student at UVU. I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sydney, Australia</a> and raised in northern Utah for most of my life. As a kid, I was always an athlete and never considered myself to be creative or artsy. However, I had many others in my family who were that way. In my mind, I could only be one thing and that was an athlete. I would take art classes in school and truly enjoyed them. I would do small art projects here and there too. I always knew I was creative but would supress that part of me until I was older. I committed to play volleyball at some colleges and did that for a few years. Throughout college is where I started exploring my creative side, when I had time away from volleyball of course. </p>
            <h2><strong>A few creative things that I have tried;</strong></h2>
            <ul> <li>Cermics/Pottery</li>
            <li>Water Color Painting</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/work-money/a32155559/how-to-start-a-bullet-journal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bullet Journaling</a></li>
                <li>Social Media/Content Creation </li>
                <li>Video/Photo Editing</li>
                <li>Photography</li>
                <li>Graphic Design for Work/Social Media</li>
            
            </ul>
            <p>I started designing on Adobe Illustrator and Procreate on my own. I would do small projects that I made up or a project that a close friend or family member asked me to do. I finally landed on Graphic Design as my degree after realizing that it was my passion. The plan for the future is to finish my degree at UVU while I create and design on the side for small clients. My goal is to start my own design business where I can set my own hours, work for myself, and work from anywhere in the world.  </p>
